First, you heat up the milk in your stove/microwave until you are satisfied with the temperature, or you can do it until it boils. 
You take it out and then add the chocolate powder, or you can also just add chocolate and mix it until it melts depending on your milk's temperature.
Mix the chocolate powder with the milk until it has completely dissolved. The next step is the most important.
Enjoy!
